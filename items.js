Our wraps are durable, waterproof, and have a scratch resistant gloss finish.  The design wraps all the way around the flask, slightly overlapping in the back. \n\nDye Sublimation, is the method of applying an image\/graphic to specially coated ceramics, metals, polyester cloth, and polymers, using specialty sublimation inks,  sublimation printers, high heat, and pressure.  Sublimation ink is unique because it is converted from a solid to a gas without becoming a liquid. The conversion is initiated by heat and high pressure. The end result is a beautiful and durable work of art that will never fade.\n\n...............................................................................................................................\n\nSHIPPING:\n\nEvery flask is made to order, so please allow for up to 1-10 business days (Mon-Fri) before your order is shipped. \n\nU.S. Orders will ship USPS first class with tracking.

Our wraps are durable, completely waterproof, and have a scratch resistant gloss finish. The design wraps all the way around the flask, slightly overlapping in the back. \r\n\r\nDye Sublimation, is the method of applying an image\/graphic to specially coated ceramics, metals, polyester cloth, and polymers, using specialty sublimation inks, sublimation printers, high heat, and pressure. Sublimation ink is unique because it is converted from a solid to a gas without becoming a liquid. The conversion is initiated by heat and high pressure.

Pour the water out. Do not let the water sit inside the flask for an extended period. If you used vinegar and baking soda, rinse the flask out several times.\r\n\r\n**Allow the flask to air-dry with the lid off.**\r\n\r\nFill the flask with the liquor or beverage of your choice when you are ready to use it. You should not leave liquor in the flask for more than three days at a time.\r\n\r\nRinse out the flask with water after every use and allow it to air-dry.","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1424534945,"vacation_autoreply":"Due to an unexpected surgery I will be unable to take any new orders for about a week.

The only exception would be FIRST CLASS MAIL, which would be 21 business days, excluding holidays.  This will be an allowable timeframe for misrouted packages to arrive to you.\r\n\r\nWe have had instances where packages delivered to apartment buildings were delayed as the mailman decided not to leave the package in the hallway unattended.\r\n\r\nWhen we send you the shipping convo, it would be a good idea to arrange to have the package delivered to a neighbor (leave a note for the mailman) or ask the post office to hold any packages at the post office for you to pickup.\r\n\r\nUPS WILL LEAVE packages unattended, so you should definately arrange to be home or leave a note for the UPS driver to deliver to a neighbor.  The neighbor would need to be a next door apt as UPS will not deliver to another building free of charge.\r\n\r\nCANADIAN and INTERNATIONAL shipments: If you require a tracking number, UPS is the only option. Please contact us to see if the shipping charges shown in the listing is for UPS or Mail. Any duties and taxes will be the responsibility of the customer.

Should the package not be returned to us, or returned damage, we will not be responsible for any refund or replacement of any amount.\r\n\r\nLOST PACKAGES SHIPPED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES:\r\nIf your package does not arrive by the estimated date provided by the post office, UPS or other delivery service, we will decide to either replace or refund your purchase 14 business days, excluding holidays, after the delivery service&#39;s estimated delivery date.  The only exception would be FIRST CLASS MAIL, which would be 21 business days, excluding holidays.  This will be an allowable timeframe for misrouted packages to arrive to you.\r\n\r\nWe have had instances where packages delivered to apartment buildings were delayed as the mailman decided not to leave the package in the hallway unattended.\r\n\r\nWhen we send you the shipping convo, it would be a good idea to arrange to have the package delivered to a neighbor (leave a note for the mailman) or ask the post office to hold any packages at the post office for you to pickup.\r\n\r\nUPS WILL LEAVE packages unattended, so you should definately arrange to be home or leave a note for the UPS driver to deliver to a neighbor.  The neighbor would need to be a next door apt as UPS will not deliver to another building free of charge.\r\n\r\nCANADIAN and INTERNATIONAL shipments: If you require a tracking number, UPS is the only option. Please contact us to see if the shipping charges shown in the listing is for UPS or Mail. Any duties and taxes will be the responsibility of the customer.  Shipments made to Canada or Internationally by a service other than UPS (ie: Postal Service) are not guarranteed as the tracking numbers are only good until the package reaches the US border, then the receiving country takes control.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSURANCE:  \r\nAll shipments ARE NOT insured.  Should you require insurance for lost packages, damage, etc, let us know prior to placing your order so we may give you a price.
