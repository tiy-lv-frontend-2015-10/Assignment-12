"title": "4 Engraved Large US Navy Whiskey Rocks / Stones & Muslin Bag, Perfect Stocking Stuffer, Great US Military Christmas Gift, Made in the USA",
"description": "Whiskey Stones are a Unique and Popular gift on their own, but when they are personalized they become extra special.\n\nThis listing is for a set of 4 Large Engraved Whiskey Stones.  They make a great gift for a current or veteran Military hero!  \n\nChristmas, Birthdays, Anniversaries, Military Weddings, Whiskey Stones are always a well received gift.\n\nEach Whiskey Stone measures 1.15&quot; x 1&quot; and is made of 100% Soapstone right here in the USA. Only 1 or 2  are needed per drink.  Each set comes in it&#39;s own Muslin Storage bag with an instructions for use card.\n\nThe pictured stones are currently engraved with the US Navy Emblem, USN and the recipients Initials however each order can be customized and I can engrave anything on the Stones, just send me your engraving instructions in the &quot;Notes to Seller&quot; section at check out or send me an Etsy Convo.

Please specify any changes in the Notes to Seller at checkout**\n\n**What are Whiskey Stones?**\n\nWhiskey Stones, are a new way to chill your whiskey or wine without diluting your drink. Ice cubes water down your whiskey and leave a moist layer of condensation on your glass, whiskey stones have all the benefits of ice without the hassles.\n\nWhiskey Stones are made out of cubes of solid soapstone which is softer than granite and won’t scratch your glass. Soapstone retains its temperature much longer than ice, so it will cool your whiskey or liquor of your choice and provide a more sustained chill. Whiskey Stones are also non-porous, odorless and tasteless so they won’t alter your favorite drinks. Whiskey Stones can also be used to warm your drinks and work well with non-alcoholic beverages too.  Whiskey stones are Dishwasher Safe.\n\n**I&#39;M ALL ABOUT CUSTOM ORDERS SO IF YOU NEED MULTIPLES PLEASE CONTACT ME FOR A DISCOUNT PRICE, I WILL DO MY BEST TO WORK WITHIN YOUR BUDGET**\n\nStill thinking and in need of more ideas?

We go through each week to see where, if any, shipping has been less and then we issue a shipping refund for the difference.  On the other hand if the shipping actually cost more than you paid, well that&#39;s our problem as we set the prices so we will take the hit.**\r\n\r\n**Shipping within the US**  We know you would like to receive your order as soon as possible, and therefore use Priority Mail for the vast majority of what we ship.  We may use First Class post for small, lighter items to make sure the postage cost is as low as possible for you.  We make no money on shipping and always try to price our shipping at the most economical and quickest route for customers.\r\n\r\n**Shipping to Canada**  To ship to Canada we use Priority Mail and First Class international mail.  Again, we price our shipping costs at the most economical we can after taking into account the shipping and packaging price.  \r\n\r\n**For Shipping everywhere else**  We welcome international orders, and ship First Class International.  We did our best to weigh items and price them for international shipping, which we know can be expensive.  However please note that none of our prices include any possible custom charges in your country of residence.  We hope you understand that though it is rare, any additional charges from your country of residence are the responsibility of the customer.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact us if you have any questions regarding shipping.",
"policy_refunds": "We hope you are fully satisfied with all items you receive, however as a business we understand there are occasions when items could arrive damaged (due to shipping).  Should any item arrive damaged or incorrect please contact us with a photo of the damage immediately so we can rectify the problem and send a replacement item asap.  Sadly, as our items are custom made we cannot resell any returns and therefore do not offer refunds on purchases.  Customer satisfaction is really important to us, we shop online all the time and get great Customer Service.  We want to go above and beyond for you so please let us know any dissatisfaction so we can rectify it ASAP.",
"policy_additional": "FAQs - \r\n\r\nDo you have any coupon codes for discounts?  \r\n\r\nYes we do, there is now a summer super sale, the following coupon codes are active from October 1st 2015 to December 31st 2015.\r\n\r\n**Super Fall Sale!**\r\n\r\nFALLSALE10 - Take 10% off any purchase up to $75\r\nFALLSALE15 - Take 15% off any purchase between $75 and $185\r\nFALLSALE20 - Take 20% off any purchase over $185\r\n(Only 1 code can be applied per order). \r\n\r\nHow long will it take for my order to be dispatched?\r\n\r\nWe know you would like your order to arrive ASAP and we want to get it to you fast.  Currently our turn around time is about 7 days on listings of more than 1 item (some small items dispatch within 2 days), however we set the dates in the shop to show 1 to 2 weeks.  This is because some orders are more complex and require more work therefore they could take longer.  Especially during High Sales periods like Christmas and Wedding Season (May through end of October).  Please rest assured we will get them made and posted to you as quickly as possible, but if you have a specific date in mind, just let us know and we will do our best for you.  \r\n\r\nDo you accept Custom Orders?\r\n\r\nYes we do, we are all about custom orders so please don&#39;t hesitate to contact us and we will be really happy to work with you.\r\n\r\nI need multiple items, but can not find a listing for the exact amount, what should I do?\r\n\r\nPlease contact us and we will create a custom listing just for you.  We offer discounts for multiples so let us know how many you need and we will do our best to work within your budget.\r\n\r\nCan you provide a proof first?\r\n\r\nWe don&#39;t offer a proof first for most orders due to the time it takes and the delay it can cause to orders, therefore we try to offer many variations of items in the shop listings.  However if you would like a proof before purchase it is available upon request.\r\n\r\nWhat Fonts do you offer for the engraving?\r\n\r\nYou can see a picture of some font examples in the item listing pictures, but there are more available, just let us know which font you would like if you can&#39;t find it on the list and we will do our best to get it for you.\r\n\r\nWe have an Official US Marine Corps Hobbyist License #31499",

We package all of our glasses securely in tissue paper, bubble wrap and packing peanuts inside a small box and put them inside larger boxes also filled with bubble wrap. In the thousands of glasses we have shipped, only one has ever broken....something we take great pride in. \r\n\r\nIn the rare event a glass is broken in transit, we unfortunately cannot accept responsibility. You will need to contact USPS directly to file a damaged claim with them, as this is most assuredly due to rough handling in transit, not a packaging issue on our end. They will probably require photos of the damaged item in the packaging, so make sure to save it!\r\n\r\nCUSTOM AND DUTY FEES:\r\n          - These will be the responsibility of the buyer.

By purchasing an item in our shop, you are acknowledging that it can be legally imported into your country. We will declare proper item value and descriptions when shipping, but are not responsible for items confiscated by customs officials due to import violations. \r\n          \r\n          - If you are uncertain of your country&#39;s import restrictions, please use this link: http://pe.usps.com/text/imm/ab_toc.htm\r\n\r\n...............................................................................\r\n...............................................................................\r\n\r\n\r\nUNCOMMON BUT NOT UNHEARD OF PROBLEMS WITH MAIL DELIVERY:\r\n\r\n          - UNABLE TO DELIVER - If a package is returned to us after unsuccessful delivery attempt by USPS due to an incorrect or incomplete address provided on the Etsy account/order, the customer will be responsible for the cost of reshipping.

"policy_additional": "SALES TAX ~ We are required to charge sales tax for all transactions from customers located in California. \r\n\r\nWOOD AND LEATHER PRODUCTS ~ All our natural wood and leather products contain a completely unique grain and hue. It is part of the appeal of a natural item. For this reason, please allow variation in engraving color and depth of these products.\r\n\r\nGLASSWARE ~ While we have many skills, making glassware is not one of them. We order our glasses through American manufacturers and hand engrave each one to order. We check each glass prior to engraving for any noticeable flaws. As each piece of glass is completely unique, please allow for small imperfections on the surface of the glass. We like to think it adds character!\r\n\r\nENGRAVING SPECS ~ We will attempt to honor all custom engraving requests, however there are some instances where a layout may not work as requested. We retain the right to use our experienced discretion to make slight changes if we feel necessary. If any large changes must be made, we will contact you first.\r\n\r\nPURCHASING OF KNIVES ~  By purchasing a knife from FrederickEngraving, you are agreeing you are at least 18 years of age. \r\n\r\nRELEASE OF LIABILITY ~ Other products that we offer may also be sharp.
